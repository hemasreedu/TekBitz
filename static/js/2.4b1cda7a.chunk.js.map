What is React ?</h4>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It is now one of the most commonly used frontend libraries for web development. <br />\r\n                            <strong>Features of React :</strong> <br />\r\n                            <strong>1. Reusable UI components: </strong>React is build using componenets. Components can be reused for developing web view.<br />\r\n                            <strong>2. Performance: </strong>React make use of virtual DOM for manipulations rather than real DOM due to which it is well known for its performance.<br />\r\n                            <strong>3. JSX : </strong>JSX is a combination of HTML and JavaScript. You can embed JavaScript objects inside the HTML elements. JSX makes it super easy for developers to write the building blocks.<br />\r\n                            <strong>4. Simplicity: </strong>React is simple to use and learn.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section id=\"funcandclass\">\r\n                        <h4>2. What are the differences between functional and class components ?</h4>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            <strong>Functional components :</strong>Functional components are nothing but Javascript functions. They can optionally accept an input of properties which is referred to as props and\r\n                            return HTML(JSX) which describes the UI.<br />\r\n                            <pre>\r\n                                <code>\r\n                                    {functCompEx()}\r\n                                </code>\r\n                            </pre>\r\n                            <br />\r\n                            <strong>Class components :</strong>Class components are basically ES6 classes. Similar to functional components, they can also optionally accept an input of properties which is referred to as props and\r\n                            return HTML(JSX). Apart from props, class components has state object which maintains information related to that component and use that information to describe the UI.\r\n                            In addition, Class comp's extend Component class from React, and impents render method which returns HTML(JSX) element.\r\n                            <pre>\r\n                                <code>\r\n                                    {classCompEx()}\r\n                                </code>\r\n                            </pre>\r\n                        </p>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section id=\"virtualdom\">\r\n                        <h4>3.What is the virtual DOM ? Explain how react make use of virtual DOM ?</h4>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            DOM manipulation is the heart of the interactive web. Unfortunately it is much slower than all the JS operations. To resolve this problem, React popularized something called the virtual DOM. <br />\r\n                            <strong>Virtual DOM :</strong> In React, for every DOM object, there is a corresponding <strong>virtual DOM object</strong>. A virtual DOM object is a representation of a DOM object, like a lightweight copy.\r\n                            A virtual DOM object has the same properties as a real DOM object, but it lacks the real things power to directly change what is on the screen. Manipulating the virtual DOM is much faster, because nothing gets drawn onscreen.<br />\r\n                            <strong>How it works in React :</strong> Once the virtual DOM has updated, then React compares the virtual DOM with a virtual DOM snapshot that was taken right before the update.\r\n                            By comparing the new virtual DOM with a pre-update version, React figures out exactly which virtual DOM objects have changed. This process is called diffing.\r\n                            Once React knows which virtual DOM objects have changed, then React updates those objects, and only those objects, on the real DOM. This makes a big difference wrt performance.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section id=\"stateandprops\">\r\n                        <h4>4.

We use props in React to pass data from one component to other (can be from parent component to child component(s)).

State object is where you store property values that belong to that component. When the value of state object changes, the component re-renders in React. State is not available in functional components, but the same can be achieved using Hooks.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section id=\"propdrilling\">\r\n                        <h4>5.

In this process,\r\n                            we start sending the data from source component and keep passing the prop to the next component till it reaches its destination component. The disadvantage of prop drilling is each and every component which\r\n                            need not require that data will have access to it.\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section id=\"errorboundary\">\r\n                        <h4>6.

In that stage, React unmounts whole react component tree.\r\n                            It would be great if we could catch the errors anywhere in the component tree and display a fallback UI.

Explain how React-Redux flow works ?</h4>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                                Redux is state management tool. <br />\r\n                                <strong>Basic idea behind Redux : </strong> A single centralized place to store the state and you can use it to any component without worrying about the hierarchy.  <br />\r\n                                Few important redux terms in brief are stated below : <br />\r\n                                <strong>STORE : </strong>Store is place where states are globally maintained. <br />\r\n                                <strong>ACTION : </strong> Action is name of the task we would like to perform. It is a simple JS function that returns an object with type as action name.<br />\r\n                                <strong>REDUCER : </strong>Reducer is responsible for taking care of action ie., handles state change. <br />\r\n                                <strong>DISPATCH : </strong>Dispatch is basically Call/execute an action. <br />\r\n                                So, to understand the redux flow we first create store and then we create actions. \r\n                                Now create reducers with state(pass initial value) and action as arguments. In reducers we perform state change based on action type i.e, we write actual implementation based on our actions.\r\n                                Now pass in created reducer(s) to store. So the control is, when we dispatch an action the control goes to action which returns\r\n                                action type. From here control goes to reducer. In reducer since we change the value of state, so it reflects in global store.\r\n                                So, to connect react with redux, we have to wrap our App component inside Provider Component, which is available in react-redux package. To the provider component we pass\r\n                                store attribute as property with value equal to above created store. With this, we say that we are providing store to app.js.\r\n                                The next thing is App.js should have access to state, so for this we use useSelector function from react-redux package. Now, to dispatch an action in App.js we make use of\r\n                                useDispatch function from same react-redux package. This is how react redux flow works.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>          \r\n        </section>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
