So the control is, when we dispatch an action the control goes to action which returns action type. From here control goes to reducer. In reducer since we change the value of state, so it reflects in global store. So, to connect react with redux, we have to wrap our App component inside Provider Component, which is available in react-redux package. To the provider component we pass store attribute as property with value equal to above created store. With this, we say that we are providing store to app.js. The next thing is App.js should have access to state, so for this we use useSelector function from react-redux package. Now, to dispatch an action in App.js we make use of useDispatch function from same react-redux package. This is how react redux flow works."]})]})]})]})})}}}]);
